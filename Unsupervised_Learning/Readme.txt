In this folder, I will upload some of the amazing projects related to Unsupervised learning. 
------- Detail of the first project -----------
The first project is kind of cool, and compicated as well. The dataset is based on more than 500,000 rows. I have first cleaned the dataset, and then performed K-Mean clustering. For ease, I wrote description of the technical stuff beneath the code as well using text cell. 
I would like to acknowledge that this project is not fully mine. It is from one of the YouTube videos. But, I faced many difficulty while working on the project as I had many questions in my mind: Why are we using this function? Why that function is used? 
I hope this project will help you understand the importance of data cleaning, and K-Mean Clustering. 
In the end, I will like to give credit to Chat GPT as well, for helping me understand the code.
